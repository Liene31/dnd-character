          <h3>
            Your DnD character is more than a role—it's the story you choose to
            live, the courage you carry, and the mark you leave on the world.
          </h3>

          <p>
            In every realm, a story stirs—waiting, watching, whispering your
            name. You may think you're just a player, but the truth is older
            than that. Somewhere in the weave of fate, a character has already
            been etched into legend, waiting for you to claim them. Are you the
            cunning Halfling who turns the tide with a smile and a sleight of
            hand? Or the brooding Tiefling whose fire hides a forgotten sorrow?
            Perhaps your strength lies in the unshakable will of a Dwarf, the
            wild grace of an Elf, or the untamed fury of an Orc. This isn't just
            a game—it's a reflection, a revelation. And all it takes is one
            step, one scroll, one choice to begin.
